        <h3><u>History of the traditional Mojito:</u></h3>
          <p><b>The name</b>Although the mojito is indeed a Cuban drink, there are several 
          theories about how it got its name. According to one theory, the name 
          mojito comes from the West African word mojo, which refers to a cloth 
          bag holding magical spices and artefacts; as a diminutive (belittling) 
          form of this loanword, mojito means "small magic." There is also a spice
          blend with the same name, which could be the source of the name, albeit 
          this mojo is made with bitter orange rather than lime. The word could 
          alternatively be derived from the Spanish verb mojar (to make something 
          wet), or it could be a contraction of the adjectives mojadito (something 
          wet) or mojado (wet).</p>
          <p><b>First Creation</b>The mojito is a rum drink with a lengthy history in the Caribbean. 
          To relieve stomach pains, British privateer Francis Drake is claimed to 
          have drank a drink made of sugar, real limes (a sour, aromatic Caribbean 
          kind), Aguardiente de Caa (a basic sugar cane alcohol), and mint as early 
          as the 16th century. Drake was dubbed "El Draque" (Spanish for "dragon") 
          by the Spaniards, and this was also the name given to the drink that was 
          eventually blended with rum as its manufacturing spread over the Caribbean. 
          In his tale El Cólera en Habana, published in 1838, Cuban author Rámon de 
          Palma wrote:"Every day at eleven o'clock I take a draquecito, and it 
          does me a lot of good."</p>
          <p><b>The traditional Mojita</b>This mixture was not called a mojito until the beginning of the 20th 
          century: According to author Ciro Bianchi Ross and Cuban historian Miguel 
          Bonera, the mojito first appeared in print in 1910 and was served at La 
          Concha in Havana. At that time, iced drinks were extremely popular and ice 
          had long been produced commercially. The mojito finally became a legend 
          through Ernest Hemingway, who ordered it from Angel Martinez in his regular 
          bar La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana. One of his sayings hangs above the bar 
          there today: "My Mojito in La Bodeguita, my Daiquiri in El Floridita".</p>
