    <p> <b>Why are Cocktails important to us?</b> Thats a great question. Cocktails are a phenomenon that surround us in many ways. 
        A quick drink after work or a full on party-night including blackouts, it doesn't matter Cocktails are present all ways.
        Also the imense variety of flavours and colours is impressive. Cocktail-making 
        is truly a form of art. Thata's why it takes an extra educational course to become a bartender. In the state of California 
        it requires 40hours of of bartenderschool. It is a underrated and underpaied ($25,580 per year) job in my opinionsadly.

   <h1>Historie of Cocktails</h1>
    <p> <b>Where comeas the term 'Cocktail' from?</b> Cocktails are often assumed to be an American invention,
        however they were influenced by British punches,
        which were large bowls of liquor blended with fruit juice,
        spices, and other ingredients and served at punch houses in the
        18th century. Cocktail was first mentioned in a British newspaper
        published in March of 1798.But it wasn't until 1806,
        when The Balance and Columbian Repository of Hudson,
        New York, came up with the term <i> <u>"a stimulating liquor made of
                any kind of sugar, water, and bitters, vulgarly called a bittered
                sling,"</i> </u> that the term wa properly defined as .Cocktails have always
        been about "stimulating," but the genuine art of bartending emerged
        owing to one man in particular—Jerry Thomas. Jerry, alias
        "Professor" Thomas, a successful American bartender from Connecticut
        who worked all throughout America and Europe and published one of the
        first comprehensive recipe books, The Bartender's Guide (or How to
        Mix Drinks), which became a benchmark for bartenders.</p>

    <p> <b>Evolution.</b>According to the Columbian Repository, cocktails
        had grown into their own category of drink by the early 1800s,
        consisting of sugar, water, and bitters. In the early twentieth
        century, the introduction of refrigeration and cheaply available
        ice transformed the scene for bartenders,
        who experienced a surge in demand for iced and shaken beverages.
        Nowadays, the social ritual that used to surround 
        cocktails is more important than the cocktails themselves. 
        When I offer someone a classic like a plain old fashioned and 
        they say, "Wow, this is like something my grandfather would have 
        prepared," I'm reminded of this. The term "prepared" is crucial. 
        That's because our forefathers and mothers didn't consume drinks 
        in a fancy cocktail bar but made them themselves at home.</p>
