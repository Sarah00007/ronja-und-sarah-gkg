 <h3><u>History:</u></h3>
  <p>The blue lagoon longdrink was invented around 1972 
      at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. Bartender Andy 
      MacElhone (who is actually the son of bar legend Harry 
      MacElhone, himself the inventor of the White Lady, 
      the Monkey Gland and the Sidecar) created the Blue 
      Lagoon on a blue whim. The year was 1980 and in the 
      middle of it all was a young actress with eyebrows 
      the likes of which the world had never seen before: 
      Brooke Shields became famous with "The Blue Lagoon" 
      and probably everyone thinks that the corresponding 
      cocktail was named after the film or the woman. But 
      that's not really the case: barman Andy MakElhon 
      probably named his creation after a thermal spa in Iceland.</p>
    
<h3><u>Drinking-game:</u></h3>
   <ul>
       <li>1.Round the Gamemaster has a deck of 'Jasscards' (neutral side up) in his hands.
         He asks every player if the Card at the top of the deck is red or black. 
         When the player has answered he turns the card around and gives it to the player 
         (He keeps that card for now). If the player was wrong with the colour he has to take a shot or sip of his drink. </li>
       <li>2. Round is the same Thing again just this time the 
        question is if the card at top has a higher or lower number than the 1st card they received. 
        Agein, if the player was wrong a shot or a sip of the drink.</li>
        <li>3. Round is once again the same principle, this time the question is if the number is between the two previous received cards or one outside.</li>
        <li>4.Round is the last round bevor the actual game starts. The question is 'What symbol of the 4 is this card?'</li>
        <li>Now every player has 4 cards on hand. Don't show yours to the others. Now you lay out two rows with each 5 cards face down on the table.</li>
        <li>It's getting a litle complicated now, one after another you turn the cards on the table face side up.</li>
        <li>If one card on your hand matches the symbol&number of one of the cards on the table, you can put yours down BUT you don't have to. 
        Because in the first row you have to take as many shots as the position of the card that matched yours. 
        Also keep in mind, you can only put your card down imediatly when the matching one got turned around.</li>
        <li>In the 2. row you don't take the amount of shots yourself but you can give them to someone.</li>
        <li>After both rows are turned the person with the most cards on hand has lost and has to ex all of the remaining drinks.</li>
   </ul>
