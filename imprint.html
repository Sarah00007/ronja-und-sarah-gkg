    <h1>World of Cocktails</h1>
  <div class="impressum">
      <p>Meraki was founded in may 2022 by the swiss students Ronja Schürch
        and Sarah Höhener. They created it due to a school project in the subject 'Informatik'
        where they had to build a website about anything they liked. After long thinking they decided
        to make it on a theme teens like: Cocktails.</p>
      <p>To get setteled on drinks and to know how those cocktails made you feel, they had to try them.
        But because both are under the legal age of drinking in switzerland, they came to a great idea.
        Ronja and Sarah just prepared the cocktails and let family and friends (above the age of 18) 
        try them out. That means all information given here is based on feedback from the testers. Nutritional 
        informations are researched on the internet. </p>
