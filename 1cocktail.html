<h3><u>History:</u></h3>
<b>1900s & 1920s:</b>
<p>Sophie Berezinski began spending more time at the workplace 
with her father in the 1900s and 1920s. The Moscow Copper Co.
begins producing copper mugs based on Sophie's design and 
specifications.<br>
When hard times strike Russia, Sophie resolves to board a ship 
with 2,000 mugs and sail to America, where she can sell the 
mugs and live a better life. Sophie relocates to New York City, 
where she meets her future husband, Max.</p>
<b>1939:</b>
<p>Sophie travels to Hollywood, California to try something 
new and, maybe, find a market for her stunning copper mugs.</p>
<b>1941:</b>
<p>Sophie creates the first Moscow Mule in her Original Mug
at the legendary Cock n' Bull Pub on Sunset Blvd in Hollywood, 
CA, with two male friends, John and Jack.</p>
<b>1948 - 1950:</b>
<p>A bartender from the Cock n' Bull decides to go out and teach 
other bartenders how to make the Moscow Mule. He'd walk into a bar 
with a polaroid camera, order a Moscow Mule, take two photos of the 
freshly constructed Moscow Mule, and leave one with the bartender. 
He'd then proceed to the next bar and show them what their competitors 
were up to, effectively spreading the Moscow Mule throughout the country. 
We like to think of it as 1940s Social Media.</p>
<b>1951-1966:</b>
<p>The Moscow Mule has become the drink of choice for Hollywood's 
"it" crowd and "A" listers.</p>
<b>1967:</b>
<p>The nation is hit hard by the Cold War, and the Moscow Mule loses 
popularity owing to political reasons. Given that the cocktail was 
conceived in the heart of Hollywood, CA, this is somewhat ironic. 
With no Moscow Mules to be found, the next 30-40 years were some 
of America's darkest.</p>
<b>1967-Today:</b>
<p>The Moscow Mule is a popular drink in pubs all around the world. 
In fact, it recently surpassed the Margarita as America's and arguably 
the world's most popular cocktail. Sophie Berezinski's legacy goes on 
at the Moscow Copper Co., where her heirs ensure that everyone has access 
to the original copper mug that makes the Moscow Mule a true Moscow Mule.</p>
